# Email Automator!
A python script to automatically send emails to multiple recipients!

This python script allows you to send an email to any number of recipients.

IMPORTANT
This script requires login information from your email account since the emails will be sent from your email address.

For this reason, it is strongly recommended for you to log in to your email provider and create an app password to use for this script.
For gmail, one can be created in your gmail settings by going to security --> app passwords --> then creating a password specifically for the script.
