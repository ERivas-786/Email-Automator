# Email Automator!
A python script to automatically send emails to multiple recipients!

This python script allows you to send an email to any number of recipients.

IMPORTANT
This script requires login information from your email account since the emails will be sent from your email address.

For this reason, it is strongly recommended for you to log in to your email provider and create an app password to use for this script.
For gmail, one can be created in your gmail settings by going to security --> app passwords --> then creating a password specifically for the script.

Once your password is generated, it can then be used alongside your email int the email sender and password fields

You can name the pdf file whatever you wish but make sure that the name in the script matches the file name EXACTLY 
Additionally, the pdf must be saved in the SAME directory as the email_messenger.py script. Save any attachments into your EMAIL_AUTOMATOR_PYTHON folder!
